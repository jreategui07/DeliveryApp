## Description

This iOS application, developed using Swift and SwiftUI, simulates a package tracking system. The app allows users to manage their deliveries by adding, updating, and tracking packages. This project showcases modern iOS development practices, including SwiftUI for building responsive UIs, @EnvironmentObject and @ObservableObject for state management, and UserDefaults for data persistence.

## Features

- **Swift**: Used for developing the application's logic.
- **SwiftUI**: For designing the user interface.
- **UserDefaults**: For persisting user data locally.
- **ObservableObject**: To manage state across views.
- **EnvironmentObject**: For sharing data between multiple views.
- **NavigationLink**: To navigate between different screens.
- **OOP**: Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles.

## Required Configuration

- No additional configuration is required.
